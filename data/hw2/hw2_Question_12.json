       "Question": "Given an input image $X$, and the kernel $K$, with a stride of 1, and a zero padding of 1 pixel around the image. What is the output of convolution of $K$ with $X$ with stride 1 and zero padding of size one?\\\\\n\n$$X = \\left(\\begin{matrix}\n1 & 2 & 1\\\\\n3 & 4 & 3\\\\\n2 & 1 & 2\\\\\n4 & 3 & 4\n\\end{matrix}\\right)$$\n\n$$K = \\left(\\begin{matrix}\n1 & 1\\\\\n2 & 2\n\\end{matrix}\\right)$$",
       "Solution": "[[2, 6, 6, 2], [7, 17, 17, 7], [7, 13, 13, 7], [10, 17, 17,10], [4, 7, 7, 4]][[2, 6, 6, 2], [7, 17, 17, 7], [7, 13, 13, 7], [10, 17, 17,10], [4, 7, 7, 4]].",
       "ChatGPT Answer": "The output of the convolution of $K$ with $X$ with stride 1 and zero padding of size one would be:\r\n\r\n14 & 16 & 14\\\\\r\n16 & 18 & 16\\\\\r\n14 & 16 & 14\r\n\\end{matrix}\\right)$$\r\nTo calculate the output, we would first add a zero padding of size one around the input image $X$, so that the new image becomes:\r\n$$\\left(\\begin{matrix}\r\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\r\n0 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 0\\\\\r\n0 & 3 & 4 & 3 & 0\\\\\r\n0 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 0\\\\\r\n0 & 4 & 3 & 4 & 0\\\\\r\n\\end{matrix}\\right)$$\r\nNext, we would perform the convolution by sliding the kernel $K$ over the padded image, element-wise multiplying and summing the entries in each position of the kernel with the corresponding entries in the image, and placing the result in the output matrix. For example, the first entry in the output matrix would be obtained by multiplying the entries in the top-left corner of the kernel with the entries in the corresponding position of the image, and summing the result:\r\n$$\\left(\\begin{matrix}\r\n1 & 1\\\\\r\n2 & 2\r\n\\end{matrix}\\right) \\times \\left(\\begin{matrix}\r\n1 & 2\\\\\r\n3 & 4\r\n\\end{matrix}\\right) = 1 \\times 1 + 1 \\times 2 + 2 \\times 3 + 2 \\times 4 = 14$$\r\nThe process would be repeated for every position in the output matrix.",
